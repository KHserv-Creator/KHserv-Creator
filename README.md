Passionate about administration and sales,
 I am ready to take on new responsibilities in
my career. 
With good interpersonal and organizational skills, 
I have successfully led
several projects, the most recent with a team of twenty employees. 
My goal is to
contribute to the development of the company while creating a motivating work
environment.
